		"imba_tutorial_intro_02"									"Everything in IMBA is stronger: heroes, items, even your buildings and creeps.\nThe game is faster paced: you will gain more gold and experience than normal, learn powerful abilities, and fights will be fast and furious.\nCan you prevail over the enemy ancient, in this battle of strategy, teamwork and reflex?"

		"imba_tutorial_power_balance_01"								"Often you will find yourself desperate, as your enemies grow stronger and stronger, and you are confined to your own base. Worry not, however, for not all is lost!"
		"imba_tutorial_power_balance_02"								"\nThe ancients' enmity is old, and the balance of their emissaries' power cannot be tipped easily. You will find that, the weaker your own team is, the greater the rewards will be for slaying your opposition."
