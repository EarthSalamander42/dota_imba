While phased, passing through units drains %drain_damage% health from them and grants it to the caster. Lasts %phase_duration% seconds.\n<h1>Passive: Lifesteal</h1> Heals the attacker for a percentage of attack damage dealt. Stacks additively with other sources of lifesteal, but not with itself.\nFlat movement speed bonuses from multiple pairs of boots do not stack."
