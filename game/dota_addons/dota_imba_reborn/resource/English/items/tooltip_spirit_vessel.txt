However, doing so will also cast the Soul Release debuff on the caster.\n<h1><font color='#FF7800'>Active: Curse Activation</font></h1> If Spirit Vessel's debuff is dispelled before half of its duration has passed, it is reapplied for its remaining duration minus %curse_activation_reduction% seconds at %curse_activation_mult%x the strength (damage, health damage, and regeneration reduction).<br><br>Certain purge effects will not trigger Curse Activation's strength increase, but will instead increase the debuff duration by %curse_activation_reduction% seconds.
