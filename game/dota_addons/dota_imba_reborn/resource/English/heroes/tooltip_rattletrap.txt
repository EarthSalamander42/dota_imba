"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_battery_assault_Description"					"Discharges high-powered shrapnel at random nearby enemy units, dealing minor magical damage and ministun.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Fragmentation Rend:</font> Turning auto-cast on increases Battery Assault's damage interval speed by %fragmentation_mult%x, but reduces its tick damage to %fragmentation_damage%%% and removes the mini-stun. Each piece of shrapnel also increases damage the target takes from all sources by %fragmentation_vuln%%%, reduces status resistance by %fragmentation_resist%%%, and reduces vision by %fragmentation_vision%%%. The debuff lasts for %fragmentation_duration% seconds, and stacks with and refreshses itself.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Percussive Maintenance:</font> Upon being attacked, there is a %percussive_maint_base_chance%%% chance of releasing one Battery Assault. If auto-cast is on, there is instead a %percussive_maint_frag_chance%%% chance of releasing one Fragmentation Rend. Does nothing if the caster's passives are disabled."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_battery_assault_Lore"							"Some of Rattletrap's contraptions don't quite work correctly, so detonating them proves useful as an offensive maneuver."

"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_power_cogs_Description"						"Forms a barrier of energized cogs around Clockwerk, trapping any units that are near.  Enemies outside the trap that touch a cog are knocked back, losing health and mana. Once a cog has delivered a shock, it will power down.  Cogs can be destroyed by enemy attacks, but Clockwerk can destroy them with just one.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Rotational:</font> Turning auto-cast on causes the cogs to rotate counter-clockwise around the cast location at an angular velocity of %rotational_speed% degrees a second.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Charge Coil:</font> Denying a Power Cog allows the attacker's next attack to apply the cog push effect on the target (stuns in place instead of knocking back). Charge Coil lasts for %charge_coil_duration% seconds and can stack multiple charges, but does not refresh previous durations."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_power_cogs_Lore"								"One of Clockwerk's inventions of which he is most proud is the power cog - though it is sometimes despised by his allies."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_power_cogs_Note0"								"Cogs can shock invisible units."

"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_power_cogs_Note2"								"Charge Coil still expends a charge if the attacker is ranged and they miss their attack."

"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_rocket_flare_Description"						"Fires a global range flare that explodes over a given area, damaging enemies and providing vision for 10 seconds.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Carpet Fire:</font> Turning auto-cast on fires %carpet_fire_rockets% flares instead of one, with a delay of %carpet_fire_delay% seconds between each flare. These flares are wildly inaccurate, landing anywhere within %carpet_fire_spread%x the standard radius of where targeted. Each flare only deals %carpet_fire_damage%%% of the standard damage.\n<font color='#FF7800'>System Critical:</font> If a Rocket Flare fired from %system_min_distance% or greater distance away lands within %system_radius% radius of an enemy, the flare deals bonus damage (%system_crit%%% of base for every %system_min_distance% distance travelled). Additionally, the enemy loses all their mana and has their mana regeneration reduced by %system_mana_loss_pct%%% for %system_duration% seconds. This effect is unpurgable.\nCarpet Fire flares must hit the enemy directly to receive the critical damage and mana regen reduction effect, and do not receive the mana destruction effect."

If the hook hits a unit, Clockwerk launches himself into the target, stunning and dealing damage.  Any enemies Clockwerk collides with along the way are damaged and stunned.\n\nUpgradable by Aghanim's Scepter.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Shish Kabob:</font> Turning auto-cast on no longer causes Hookshot to stop at the first target it hits, instead extending its full length. Upon full extension, Clockwerk will pull himself towards the last unit hit, dragging all non magic-immune units (friend or foe) within %stun_radius% radius along the way.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Razor Wind:</font> If Hookshot passes by an enemy within %razor_wind_radius% radius but does not latch onto them, they take %razor_wind_damage%%% of Hookshot's standard damage and are mini-stunned. Pierces magic immunity."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_hookshot_Lore"									"A somewhat unwieldy device, the Hookshot sends the otherwise clunky Clockwerk armor flying through the air."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_rattletrap_hookshot_Note0"								"Hookshot will latch and take Clockwerk to allies, but not damage or disable them."
