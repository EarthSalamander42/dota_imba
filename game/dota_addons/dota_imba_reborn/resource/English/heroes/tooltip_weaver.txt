"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_the_swarm_Description"					"Weaver launches a swarm of %count% young Weavers that latch on any enemy unit in their path, attacking and reducing armor until it is killed.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Aggravate:</font> If Weaver attacks a target affected by The Swarm debuff, the beetle applies another instance of armor reduction.\n<font color='#FF7800'>M. Eater:</font> Also burns mana equal to %mana_burn_pct%%% of its own damage (before manipulations)."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_the_swarm_Lore"						"Skitskurr opens a gap in the space time fabric, allowing young Weavers to slip through and aid him in combat."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_the_swarm_Note0"						"When a beetle latches on a target, it will remain there until it is killed or the duration expires."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_the_swarm_Note1"						"Beetles are Spell Immune, but can be killed in 4 attacks from a hero, or 8 from other units."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_the_swarm_Note2"						"Beetles provide 321/321 sight unless the target is invisible."

"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_shukuchi_Description"					"Weaver shifts out of visibility, gaining the ability to move at maximum speed through physical units--doing harm to any enemies it passes through.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Glitch Point:</font> Can be set to auto-cast to create a marker at Weaver's current location. Casting Shukuchi will immediately port Weaver to that marker, setting its own cooldown to 0 seconds. Turning auto-cast off or dying removes the marker."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_shukuchi_Lore"							"As the Weavers worked in the fabric of creation, small wormholes allowed them to slip through time to better work their craft."

Activating Geminate Attack with auto-cast on causes Weaver to warp to a random vector around the attacked target (distance between the attacker and target stays the same). Disjoints projectiles, and destroys trees around the warp point."
"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_weaver_geminate_attack_Lore"					"Skitskurr's relationship with time is somewhat variable, causing his actions to be witnessed - and felt - more than once."
