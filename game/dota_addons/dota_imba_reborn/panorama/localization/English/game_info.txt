"imba_tutorial_intro_01"															"Dota IMBA is the answer to the question: What would happen if Icefrog went mad, and buffed every hero 100 patches in a row?"
"imba_tutorial_intro_02"															"Everything in IMBA is stronger: heroes, items, even your buildings and creeps.\nThe game is faster paced: you will gain more gold and experience than normal, learn powerful abilities, and fights will be fast and furious.\nCan you prevail over the enemy ancient, in this battle of strategy, teamwork and reflex?"

"imba_tutorial_heroes_title"														"HEROES"
"imba_tutorial_heroes_01"															"Your hero is stronger than normal. You might hit harder, be sturdier, take less time to attack, or move faster."
"imba_tutorial_heroes_02"															"\nYour hero's abilities will have some extra effects. Hover over your ability buttons to see them <font color='#FF7800'>in this color.</font>"
"imba_tutorial_heroes_03"															"\nSome heroes will also gain wholly new abilities, like the ones you see below."

"imba_tutorial_items_title"															"ITEMS"
"imba_tutorial_items_01"															"Most items will have increased power, but some will also have extra passive or active abilities. Those will also be written <font color='#FF7800'>in this color.</font>"
"imba_tutorial_items_02"															"\nThere are also plenty of IMBA-exclusive items, and upgrades to existing items. You can peruse the shop and discover some of those, like the Boomstick, on your own!"

"imba_tutorial_creeps_title"														"CREEPS AND BUILDINGS"
"imba_tutorial_creeps_01"															"Creeps and buildings will grow more powerful as time passes. Do not be discouraged, however, as the reward for slaying them will also become greater!"

"imba_tutorial_roshan_title"														"ROSHAN"
"imba_tutorial_roshan_01"															"Roshan is also all-powerful on IMBA, and taking him down is an achievement in itself. If you manage it, however, you will be rewarded with an Aegis which does not use up an item slot, and an ever-growing number of Cheeses!"

"imba_tutorial_power_balance_title"													"POWER BALANCE"
"imba_tutorial_power_balance_01"													"Often you will find yourself desperate, as your enemies grow stronger and stronger, and you are confined to your own base. Worry not, however, for not all is lost!"
"imba_tutorial_power_balance_02"													"\nThe ancients' enmity is old, and the balance of their emissaries' power cannot be tipped easily. You will find that, the weaker your own team is, the greater the rewards will be for slaying your opposition."
"imba_tutorial_power_balance_03"													"\nEven when one of your allies cowardly abandons the battlefield, worry not, for the Ancient's rage will only be fueled further, granting you and your remaining teammates even greater rewards when killing an enemy."
"imba_tutorial_power_balance_04"													"\nBe wary, however, as the opposing ancient is just as crafty and full of tricks. Sometimes, a swift and decisive victory may be easier to achieve than a drawn-out, rollercoaster ride of a win."
