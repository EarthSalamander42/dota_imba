"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_item_imba_cyclone_2_Description"					"<h1>Active: Cyclone</h1> Sweeps a target unit up into a cyclone, making them invulnerable for %cyclone_duration% seconds. Cyclone can only be cast on enemy units or yourself.<br><br>Enemy units take %tooltip_drop_damage% magical damage upon landing.<br><br>Range: %abilitycastrange%<br>Dispel Type: <span class=\"GameplayValues GameplayVariable\">Basic Dispel</span>\n<h1>Active: Tornado Towers</h1>Cyclone also spawns %tornado_count% tornadoes %tornado_spacing% distance spaced evenly around the original cyclone area for its duration. These tornadoes continously attempt to pull enemies within %tornado_radius% radius towards them at a speed of %tornado_pull_speed%, and also exert a leash effect, preventing the usage of most movement abilities. Multiple Tornado Towers debuffs fully stack.\n<h1>Active: Disorient</h1> If Cyclone is cast on an enemy, after Cyclone ends, the target's status resistance is reduced by %disorient_status_resistance%%% for %disorient_duration% seconds. This effect is unpurgable and ignores status resistance."

// \n<h1>Active: Violent Displacement</h1>If Cyclone is self-cast, the caster will rotate around at intense speeds, but will ultimately land %displacement_distance% distance away from the original Cyclone position. Direction is based on the caster's forward vector upon cast. Disjoints projectiles upon landing.
