		"imba_tutorial_intro_02"															"Everything in IMBA is stronger: heroes, items, even your buildings and creeps.\nThe game is faster paced: you will gain more gold and experience than normal, learn powerful abilities, and fights will be fast and furious.\nCan you prevail over the enemy ancient, in this battle of strategy, teamwork and reflex?"
