## Branching and copying
Feel free to create branches or copy the repo as you see fit for your uses. The repo is open source for a reason - you're free to use all abilities, items, et cetera provided here; just make sure to credit from where they came from.

## Contributing to Dota IMBA
Currently we examine all suggestions before implementing them, on the IMBA development discord channel. You can send a message to me through Github in the link: https://github.com/EarthSalamander42, or PM me in either Dota IMBA's Reddit or Discord server for further details.

Feel free to just implement your suggestion/fix without talking to us, but please understand that there's a chance it might get ignored for game balance or other reasons. Thank you!

Also see the CONTRIBUTING files for conventions

## Reporting bugs
Report bugs by opening issues in our dota imba site https://mods.frostrose-studio.com/. Registration is easy and short and it would be very helpful for us to track bugs.
